Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets.

PCA transforms data into a new subspace using orthogonal transformations, converting correlated features into uncorrelated principal components that capture the most significant patterns. Each principal component is a unit vector orthogonal to the previous ones, forming an orthonormal basis. Each principal component explains a decreasing amount of the total variance in the data, with the first component explaining the most.

Each principal component is derived as a linear combination of the original features in the dataset, with the first principal component capturing the highest variance in the data, followed by the second capturing the next highest variance, and so forth
